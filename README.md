**Supervisor:** Debasis Ganguly

**Title:** Code2Text: Methods of Plain Text Code Summarization

**Abstract:**
When we as computer scientists want to write a program, we must understand the code we write, as software engineers we must document our code to help others understand what we have written. The models created within this project aim to automate the writing of a plain text summary of code. The conversion of syntax to plain text, specifically English, has many applications within Computing Science, these models will exist in such a way that they can be used across these applications in downstream tasks such as automated codebase documentation and assisting teaching within Computing Science.
