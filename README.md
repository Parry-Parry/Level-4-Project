**Title:** Code2Text: Methods of Plain Text Code Summarization

**Abstract:**
When we as computer scientists create a program, we must understand the code we write, as software engineers we must document our code to help others understand what we have written. The models created within this project attempt to automate the writing of a plain text summary of code. The conversion of syntax to plain text, specifically English, has many applications within Computing Science, these models have applications in downstream tasks such as automated codebase documentation and assisting teaching within Computing Science. We utilise a BERT2BERT architecture for the first time in code translation and experiment with a novel preprocessing step, docstring augmentation.

We observe an increase in BLEU scores through augmentation and reflect upon both the improvements and noise found through augmentation.
